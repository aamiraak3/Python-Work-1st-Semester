		Defining Functions

There are two main tasks to complete.

(a) Write a function with the exact name get_area which takes the radius of a circle as input and calculates
the area. (You might want to import the value of pi from the math module for this calculation.)

(b) Write another function named output_parameter. This should, again, take in one number as input,
consider this number as the radius of a circle and calculate the parameter of the circle.
However, you area not required to return the parameter. Instead, the function should simply output the following:

The parameter of the circle with radius (radius) is (parameter)
Where (radius) should be replaced with the radius given as input to the function and (parameter) should be replaced with the parameter you just calculated.
For example, if we give 1.0 as input to this function, it should output the following:
The parameter of the circle with radius 1.0 is 6.283185
