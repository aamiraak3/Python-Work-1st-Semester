		NUCES Grades and SGPA

There are two main tasks to complete.

(a) Write a function with the name get_grade the takes in the total marks as input and calculates the grade according to FAST NUCES standard.This standard is given in the following table:

Grade          Given when marks are at least Point      Equivalent
A+                            90                           4.00
A                             86                           4.00
A-                            82                           3.67
B+                            78                           3.33
B                             74                           3.00
B-                            70                           2.67
C+                            66                           2.33
C                             62                           2.00
C-                            58                           1.67
D+                            54                           1.33
D                             50                           1.00
F                             0                            0.00

Note that according to the rules, the total points scored by the student are rounded to the nearest integer before assigning them a grade.

(b) The second function you need to write is calculate_sgpa. This function takes in three inputs – each input representing a grade received in a subject – and calculate the Semester GPA (SGPA) based on the point equivalent of the grades. For instance, if the function is called with the grades ’A’, ’A’ and ’D’, it will
return SGPA of 3.0 since (4+4+1)/3 = 3.0.
However, this function also allows the caller to calculate SGPA of less than three subjects. The way to do this is to send the value ’nothing’ as one or two of the arguments. For example, if the function is called with the values ’A’, ’B’, ’nothing’, it should return 3.5.

	Tasks to do

	Algorithm 1 SGPA Calculation
1: procedure CALCULATE_SGPA(grade1, grade2, grade3)
2:   total_marks 0
3:   total_number_of_subjects 0
4:   if grade1 does not equal ‘nothing’ then
5: 	increment total_number_of_subjects
6:	increase total_marks according to the point equivalent of grade1 (see table for point equiv.)
7:   if grade2 does not equal ‘nothing’ then
8: 	increment total_number_of_subjects
9: 	increase total_marks according to the point equivalent of grade2 (see table for point equiv.)
10:   if grade3 does not equal ‘nothing’ then
11: 	increment total_number_of_subjects
12: 	increase total_marks according to the point equivalent of grade3 (see table for point equiv.)
13:   if total_number_of_subjects is 0 then
14: 	return 0 as answer
15:   SGPA total_marks / total_number_of_subjects
	return SGPA
