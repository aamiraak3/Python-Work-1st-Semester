		Square Roots and Guesses

Assumptions and requirements:

(a) For all these taks, your results must be accurate up to five decimal places.

(b) For the whole assignment, assume no negative numbers will be passed to any functions.

(c) You must not use the functions in the math or another library during this assignment. You must also not use the buit-in Python average function. If you break this rule, you risk getting zero score on the whole assignment.

	There are three main tasks to complete.

(a) Write a function with the name average that takes in two inputs and calculates the arithmetic mean (simple average) of the two numbers. You must not assume anything about the two numbers (other than the fact that they will not be complex).

(b) Write another function named improve_guess. This improvement in guess will be made according to the rule typically associated with the Heron of Alexandia. According to this rule:
If there is a guess a for the square root of a number x then the average of a and x/a is a better guess.Read through this statement carefully and write the function accordingly. You should use the function average defined in the task above within this function.

(c) Finally, write a function sqrt similar to what we wrote in the class, except it should use the new improve_guess function you just defined. Assume this function will only be given guesses greater
than or equal to 0.
